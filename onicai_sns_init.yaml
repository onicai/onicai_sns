# To simulate SNS params, use the SNS analyzer:
# https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/tokenomics
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In this file, 1 year is nominally defined to be 365.25 days.
#
# This gets passed to `sns propose`. See propose_sns.sh.
#
# This follows the second configuration file format developed for the `sns`
# CLI.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# UNITS
#
# This SNS configuration file version allows specifying the various
# fields with units that make configuration easier. For instance,
# in the previous version, all fields relating to token values
# had to be specified in e8s (fractions of 10E-8 of a governance token).
# In this version, similar fields can be specified in whole tokens,
# tokens with decimals, or e8s. Below is more information on the type
# of units that can be used.
#
# For fields that represent token values (such as `transaction_fee`
# or `rejection_fee`), devs can specify decimal strings ending in
# "tokens" (plural), decimal strings ending in "token" (singular),
# or integer strings (base 10) ending in "e8s". In the case of
# "tokens" strings, the maximum number of digits after the (optional)
# decimal point is 8. The "_" character may be sprinkled throughout.
# Whitespace around number is insignificant. E.g. " 42 tokens" is
# equivalent to "42tokens".
#
# For fields that represent duration values (such as `initial_voting_period`
# or `minimum_dissolve_delay`), devs can specify durations as a concatenation
# of time spans. Where each time span is an integer number and a suffix.
# Supported suffixes:
#  - seconds, second, sec, s
#  - minutes, minute, min, m
#  - hours, hour, hr, h
#  - days, day, d
#  - weeks, week, w
#  - months, month, M -- defined as 30.44 days
#  - years, year, y -- defined as 365.25 days
#
# For example, "1w 2d 3h" gets parsed as
#
# 1 week + 2 days + 3 hours
#    =
# (1 * (7 * 24 * 60 * 60) + 2 * 24 * 60 * 60 + 3 * (60 * 60)) seconds
#
# For fields that represent percentage values (such as `bonus`), devs specify
# the value as an integer with a trailing percent sign ('%'). For example,
# `10%`.
#
# For fields that represent time of day (such as `start_time`), devs specify
# the value as a string in form "hh::mm UTC". Where hh is hour, and mm is minute.
# Only the UTC timezone is currently supported.

# Configures SNS proposal-related fields. These fields define the initial values
# for some of the nervous system parameters related to SNS proposals. This will
# not affect all SNS proposals submitted to the newly created SNS.
Proposals:
    # The cost of making an SNS proposal that is rejected by the SNS neuron
    # holders. This field is specified as a token. For example: "1 token".
    rejection_fee: 1000 tokens

    # The initial voting period of an SNS proposal. A proposal's voting period
    # may be increased during its lifecycle due to the wait-for-quiet algorithm
    # (see details below). This field is specified as a duration. For example
    # "4 days".
    initial_voting_period: 4 days

    # The wait-for-quiet algorithm extends the voting period of a proposal when
    # there is a flip in the majority vote during the proposal's voting period.
    #
    # Without this, there could be an incentive to vote right at the end of a
    # proposal's voting period, in order to reduce the chance that people will
    # see and have time to react to that.
    #
    # If this value is set to 1 day, then a change in the majority vote at the
    # end of a proposal's original voting period results in an extension of the
    # voting period by an additional day. Another change at the end of the
    # extended period will cause the voting period to be extended by another
    # half-day, etc.
    #
    # The total extension to the voting period will never be more than twice
    # this value.
    #
    # For more information, please refer to
    # https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/NNS_Canisters#Proposal_decision_and_wait-for-quiet
    #
    # This field is specified as a duration. For example: "1 day".
    maximum_wait_for_quiet_deadline_extension: 1 day

# Configuration of SNS voting.
Neurons:
    # The minimum amount of SNS tokens to stake a neuron. This field is specified
    # as a token. For instance, "1 token".
    minimum_creation_stake: 50 tokens

# Configuration of SNS voting.
Voting:
    # The minimum dissolve delay a neuron must have to be able to cast votes on
    # proposals.
    #
    # Dissolve delay incentivizes neurons to vote in the long-term interest of
    # an SNS, as they are rewarded for longer-term commitment to that SNS.
    #
    # Users cannot access the SNS tokens used to stake neurons (until the neuron
    # is dissolved). This field is specified as a duration. For example: "6 months".
    minimum_dissolve_delay: 1 month

    # Configuration of voting power bonuses that are applied to neurons to
    # incentivize alignment with the best interest of the DAO. Note, these
    # bonuses multiply each other, so the increase in voting power due to
    # the dissolve delay bonus is used in the equation to increase voting
    # power for the age bonus.
    MaximumVotingPowerBonuses:
        # Users with a higher dissolve delay are incentivized to take the
        # long-term interests of the SNS into consideration when voting. To
        # reward this long-term commitment, this bonus can be set to a
        # percentage greater than zero, which will result in neurons having
        # their voting power increased in proportion to their dissolve delay.
        #
        # For example, if the user has a dissolve delay of 6 months, and
        # the maximum dissolve delay duration (defined below as `duration`)
        # for the dissolve delay bonus is 12 months, and the maximum bonus
        # (defined as `bonus` below) is set to 10%, then that user’s voting
        # power will be 105% of their normal voting power based on staked
        # tokens (i.e. they will have a bonus of 5%). If the user increased
        # their dissolve delay to 9 months, they would get 107.5% of the normal
        # voting power of their tokens. And if they increased to 12 months, they
        # would get 110%. If they increase further, they get no additional bonus.
        #
        # If you do not want this bonus to be applied for neurons with higher
        # dissolve delay, set `bonus` to `0%` and those neurons will not receive
        # higher voting power.
        DissolveDelay:
            # This parameter sets the maximum dissolve delay a neuron can have.
            # When reached, the maximum dissolve delay bonus will be applied.
            # This field is specified as a duration. For example: "8 years".
            duration: 24 months
            # If a neuron's dissolve delay is `duration`, its voting power will
            # be increased by the dissolve delay `bonus` amount. 
            # This field is specified as a percentage. For instance, 
            # a value of "100%" means that the voting power will be doubled
            # (multiplied by 2).
            bonus: 100%

        # Users with neurons staked in the non-dissolving state for a long
        # period of time are incentivized to take the long-term interests of
        # the SNS into consideration when voting. To reward this long-term
        # commitment, this bonus can be set to a percentage (greater than zero),
        # which will result in neurons having their voting power increased in
        # proportion to their age.
        #
        # For example, if the neuron has an age of 6 months, and the maximum age
        # duration (defined below as `duration`) for the age bonus is 12 months,
        # and the maximum bonus (defined as `bonus` below) is set to 10%, then
        # that neuron’s voting power will be 105% of their normal voting power
        # based on staked tokens plus dissolve delay bonus (i.e. they will have a
        # bonus of 5%). If neuron aged another 3 months to have an age of 9 months,
        # the neuron would get 107.5% of the normal voting power. And if the neuron
        # aged another 3 months to 12 months, the neuron would get 110%. If the neuron
        # ages further, it get no additional bonus.
        #
        # If this bonus should not be applied for older neurons, set the bonus
        # to `0%` and older neurons will not receive higher voting power.
        Age:
            # This parameter sets the duration of time the neuron must be staked
            # in the non-dissolving state, in other words its `age`, to reach
            # the maximum age bonus. Once this age is reached, the neuron will
            # continue to age, but no more bonus will be applied. This field
            # is specified as a duration. For example: "2 years".
            duration: 12 months
            # If a neuron's age is `duration` or older, its voting power will be
            # increased by this age`bonus` amount. 
            # This field is specified as a percentage. For instance, 
            # a value of "25%" means that the voting power will increase by a quarter
            # (multiplied by 1.25).
            bonus: 25%

    # Configuration of SNS voting reward parameters.
    #
    # The voting reward rate controls how quickly the supply of the SNS token
    # increases. For example, setting `initial` to `2%` will cause the supply to
    # increase by at most `2%` per year. A higher voting reward rate
    # incentivizes users to participate in governance, but also results in
    # higher inflation.
    #
    # The initial and final reward rates can be set to have a higher reward rate
    # at the launch of the SNS and a lower rate further into the SNS’s lifetime.
    # The reward rate falls quadratically from the `initial` rate to the `final`
    # rate over the course of `transition_duration`.
    #
    # Setting both `initial` and `final` to `0%` will result in the system not
    # distributing voting rewards at all.
    #
    # More details on SNS tokenomics can be found in the developer documentation:
    # https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics/rewards/#voting-rewards
    RewardRate:
        # The initial reward rate at which the SNS voting rewards will increase
        # per year. This field is specified as a percentage. For example: "15%".
        initial: 4%

        # The final reward rate at which the SNS voting rewards will increase
        # per year. This rate is reached after `transition_duration` and remains
        # at this level unless changed by an SNS proposal. This field is
        # specified as a percentage. For example: "5%".
        final: 0%

        # The voting reward rate falls quadratically from `initial` to `final`
        # over the time period defined by `transition_duration`.
        #
        # Values of 0 result in the reward rate always being `final`.
        #
        # This field is specified as a duration. For example: "8 years".
        transition_duration: 4 years

# Configuration of the initial token distribution of the SNS. You can configure
# how SNS tokens are distributed in each of the three groups:
# (1) tokens that are given to the original developers of the dapp,
# (2) treasury tokens that are owned by the SNS governance canister, and
# (3) tokens which are distributed to the decentralization swap participants.
#
# The initial token distribution must satisfy the following preconditions to be
# valid:
#    - The sum of all developer tokens in E8s must be less than `u64::MAX`.
#    - The Swap's initial balance (see group (3) above) must be greater than 0.
#    - The Swap's initial balance (see group (3) above) must be greater than or
#      equal to the sum of all developer tokens.
Distribution:
    # The initial neurons created when the SNS Governance canister is installed.
    # Each element in this list specifies one such neuron, including its stake,
    # controlling principal, memo identifying this neuron (every neuron that
    # a user has must be identified by a unique memo), dissolve delay, and a
    # vesting period. Even though these neurons are distributed at genesis,
    # they are locked in a (restricted) pre-initialization mode until the
    # decentralization swap is completed. Note that `vesting_period` starts
    # right after the SNS creation and thus includes the pre-initialization mode
    # period.
    #
    # For example:

        # the first neuron in each neuron basket will have zero dissolve delay;
        # the 2nd will have dissolve delay `interval`; if present, the 3rd will
        # have dissolve delay `interval` × 2, etc.
        #
        # This value must be greater than or equal to `2`

        # The interval at which the schedule will be increased per event. The
        # first neuron in the basket will be unlocked with zero dissolve delay.
        # Each other neuron in the schedule will have its dissolve delay
        # increased by `interval` compared to the previous one. For example,
        # if `events` is set to `3` and `interval` is `1 month`, then each
        # participant's neuron basket will have three neurons (with equal stake)
        # with dissolve delays zero, 1 month, and 2 months. Note that the notion
        # of `Distribution.neurons.vesting_period` applies only to developer
        # neurons. While neuron basket neurons do not use `vesting_period`, they
        # have a vesting schedule. This field is specified as a duration. For
        # example: "1 month".
        interval: 3 months

    # Absolute time of day when the decentralization swap is supposed to start.
    #
    # An algorithm will be applied to allow at least 24 hours between the time
    # of execution of the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal and swap start.
    # For example, if start_time is 23:30 UTC and the proposal is adopted and
    # executed at 23:20 UTC, then the swap start will be at 23:30 UTC the next
    # day (i.e., in 24 hours and 10 min from the proposal execution time).
    #
    # WARNING: Swap start_time works differently on mainnet and in testing.
    #
    # On mainnet:
    # - Setting start_time to some value (e.g., 23:30 UTC) will allow the swap
    #   participants to be prepared for the swap in advance, e.g.,
    #   by obtaining ICPs that they would like to participate with.
    # - If start_time is not specified, the actual start time of the swap will
    #   be chosen at random (allowing at least 24 hours and less than 48 hours,
    #   as described above).
    #
    # In testing:
    # - Setting start_time to some value works the same as explained above.
    # - If start_time is not specified, the swap will begin immediately after
    #   the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal is executed. This facilitates
    #   testing in an accelerated manner.
    #
    start_time: 16:00 UTC  # Intentionally commented out for testing.

    # The duration of the decentralization swap. When `start_time` is calculated
    # during CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal execution, this `duration` will
    # be added to that absolute time and set as the swap's deadline.
    duration: 21 days
